Welcome to my research website.

Here I will be going through several steps to do quality control on a set of hapmap3 data using workflowr.

These are my analysis files:

* [Converting to Plink](00-Converting_to_plink_format.html) 

* [Missingness Filtering](01-MissingnessFiltering.html) 

* [Relatedness Filtering](02-RelatednessFiltering.html)

Thank you.
