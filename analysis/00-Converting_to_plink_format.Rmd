## Code

This step converts the downloaded hapmap data to bed/bim/fam to be used by plink.

``` {}
./plink --file hapmap3 --make-bed --out hapmap3
```

## Details

The hapmap files that were downloaded were renamed as "hapmap3.map" and "hapmap3.ped" to make it easier.

From the line of code, several output files are created:

* hapmap3.bed
  
* hapmap3.bim
  
* hapmap3.fam
  
* hapmap3.hh
  
* hapmap3.log

The files that we are especially looking for are the bed/bim/fam files so that it can be used by plink in further analysis.
